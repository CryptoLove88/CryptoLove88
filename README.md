## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 7 years of experience, specializing in blockchain technology for the past 6 years. My work focuses on building decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEX), and smart contract solutions. Iâ€™ve designed and implemented complex distributed systems using Microservices architecture and RESTful APIs, and Iâ€™m experienced in managing large-scale platforms with Kubernetes and AWS. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and setting up robust automated testing and CI/CD pipelines. Iâ€™ve led development teams and collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions that drive real business value. My tech stack includes Typescript, Node.js, Solidity, Golang, Rust, React.js, and Next.js, and I have a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. I enjoy solving complex technical challenges, leveraging my deep understanding of algorithms and data structures.
I'm very confident in my skills and I'm sure my skills will contribute to your company.
